The goals of this project are to test my knowledge of html and css 64% through the foundations course

I'll definitely be using
- the basic html I already learned to set up divs, lists, links, etc
- simple css to color and shape the different box components of the page
- a lot of flexbox (sizing and positioning the boxes that make up the web page)

Notes as I go:
- I dropped the images of what the site should look like into the vs code project and I've got a nice workflow of switching between that, the code, and the preview window from the vs code plugin, all in the same app

Final thoughts:
- I gotta remember to not use flexbox column for the entire webpage!! Using the default block layout will automatically organize everything vertically, I should just use flexbox for positioning elements inside a container
- I went back and redid the flexbox for the header and header info sections.. I wanted it to scale with the screen width better. To get an effect of a consistent margin with elements spread vertically I used an extra container with display: flex and the margin, and then the child elements use flex grow and shrink to fill the space. Definitely need a little more practice with it to really get it down..
- I haven't been using the alternative box model (border box) gotta experiment with that more... I think it's standard
