The goals of this project are to test my knowledge of html and css 64% through the foundations course

I'll definitely be using
- the basic html I already learned to set up divs, lists, links, etc
- simple css to color and shape the different box components of the page
- a lot of flexbox (sizing and positioning the boxes that make up the web page)
